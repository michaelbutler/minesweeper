# Contributing

Contributions welcome. To contribute, checkout the code,
make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Please run `make format` (note: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is
required, install it first) and all your JS and CSS code will be automatically
formatted to the standard. You may run `make ci` to check the code prior to
committing as well.

## To Do:

- Add unit tests
- Implement better JavaScript package standards
- Separate html template code
- ReactJs? Webpack?? Modernize it.
